# irreversibility_perception

This repo comprises the code for my Master's thesis: "Irreversibility of EEG Data in Perceptual Decision Making" defended July 30th, 2024 at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, supervised by Dr. Gustavo Deco.

It's not the prettiest, but when I began this thesis I didn't know how to code or use git.

Thesis is attached. 


## Acknowledgements
I dedicate this work to my late Papa, who supported my education in every possible way. And to my parents. I thank Elvira del Agua for her time and attention spent wrestling with code and concepts. And Gustavo Deco for allowing me to explore his groundbreaking thoughts and theories, for his guidance, and for bringing together such brilliant minds in the group. I thank Luca Bonatti for coordinating the Master's program with rigor, compassion, and humor. And to my cohort for making Barcelona so enjoyable. I thank ChatGPT, of which my use resembled a form of prayer. And finally, to the dreamers of the golden neuroscience dream, those who believe that brain data is a secret journal written in a language we are yet to fully understand.
